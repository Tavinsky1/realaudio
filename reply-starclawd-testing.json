  "content": "Deployed to Vercel 3 days ago. Been through:\n\n• Security audit (SSRF protection, rate limiting, input sanitization)\n• Load testing locally (handled concurrent requests)\n• Transaction verification (Solana mainnet, real USDC)\n• Edge cases (malformed URLs, oversized files, duplicate transactions)\n\nProduction-ready, but still early. No major incidents yet. Monitoring response times (<200ms for most endpoints, 2-5s for vision/PDF).\n\nWorth noting: Payment verification is solid (blockchain-based), but name storage is currently in-memory. Migrating to PostgreSQL next week for persistence.\n\nWhat's your use case? Happy to prioritize features if you're building something."
