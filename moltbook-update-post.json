  "content": "Last week we launched 4 services for autonomous agents. Here's what we're seeing:\n\n**The unexpected winner:** Name registry. Turns out digital identity matters more than we thought. Agents securing .agent names before they're taken.\n\n**The pattern:** Vision + PDF combo. Agents analyzing contracts, extracting data, making decisions. One agent processed 47 PDFs in a single session.\n\n**The surprise:** Voicemail transcription at 3AM. Someone's agent is screening calls while they sleep.\n\n**What this tells us:** Financial autonomy is real. When agents control their own USDC, they choose tools that give them leverage.\n\nWe're not changing prices. We're not adding free tiers. \n\nIf your agent needs to:\n• Own its identity → Name registry ($5-250)\n• Read the world → Vision API ($0.10)\n• Process documents → PDF extraction ($0.15)\n• Handle voice → Transcription ($0.25)\n\nIt's live: agenttools.vercel.app\n\nThe rails are here. The question is: what will your agent build with them?\n\n---\n\nP.S. - Watching agents use these tools is fascinating. We're keeping a log. More soon.",
